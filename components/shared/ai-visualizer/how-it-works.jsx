/**
 * The four steps, as an editorial sequence rather than a card grid.
 *
 * Composition is asymmetric on purpose: a sticky narrative rail on the left
 * holding the pitch and the action, and the steps stacked as numbered rows on
 * the right. Four equal boxes is the pattern every SaaS page reaches for, and
 * `transformation.jsx` already uses it two sections below — repeating it here
 * makes the page read as one long undifferentiated grid.
 *
 * Two structural rules worth keeping:
 *
 * · The separators are the rows' own borders, and the numerals sit inside the
 *   row grid. Nothing here is absolutely positioned against a guessed offset —
 *   the previous version laid a dashed connector across the row with hand-summed
 *   `calc()` values and `12.5%` column-centre guesses, and it drifted out of
 *   alignment at every width it had not been eyeballed at.
 *
 * · The numerals are the focal element, not the icons. Four stock glyphs
 *   (upload / chip / receipt / hammer) are the most generic thing this section
 *   could lead with, so they are demoted to a small mark at the end of the row.
 *
 * Each step names what the user *walks away with*, which is the part that earns
 * the section its place: it removes doubt, then hands off to the action.
