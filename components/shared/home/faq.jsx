const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What areas does TBM serve?",
    a: "TBM currently operates in Abuja and Lagos, with delivery and project execution teams in both cities. We are expanding to other major Nigerian cities.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the Ziora AI design tool work?",
    a: "Upload a photo of your room, select the room type and your preferred style, and Ziora generates a premium design concept within seconds. You can then use the result to get an estimate, shop matching materials, or book a consultation.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I buy materials without booking a renovation project?",
    a: "Absolutely. The Bogat store is fully independent — you can browse, add to cart, and checkout for any product without engaging TBM for project execution.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a typical bathroom renovation take?",
    a: "Most bathroom renovations take 2–4 weeks depending on scope, existing conditions, and material availability. Your project manager will give you a precise timeline after the initial inspection.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer a warranty on completed projects?",
    a: "Yes. TBM provides a workmanship warranty on all executed projects, and Bogat materials carry manufacturer warranties. Full details are included in every project agreement.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the consultation fee?",
    a: "Initial consultations are structured to give you a full project assessment, scope, and estimate. Our team will confirm current consultation fees during the booking step — and the fee is credited toward your project if you proceed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I track my project progress?",
    a: "Yes. Your account dashboard includes a project tracker where you can see milestone updates, material delivery status, and team notes throughout the build.",
  },
