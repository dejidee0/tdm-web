 * Edge route protection.
 *
 * Next.js 16 renamed this file convention from `middleware` to `proxy`. It is
 * unrelated to lib/proxy.js, which is the backend API passthrough.
 *
 * Until now these route trees were served to anyone who asked and protection
 * was left to client-side redirects, so the admin and vendor shells shipped to
 * unauthenticated visitors before any check ran.
 *
 * This is a gate, not an authorisation decision: the signature is verified by
 * the backend on every data call, and lib/proxy.js only ever attaches a token
 * it reads from an httpOnly cookie. Here we just refuse to render a private
 * shell to a request that plainly has no session.
